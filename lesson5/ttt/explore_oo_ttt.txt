TTT is a game where 2 player takes turn placing either X or O on a board, which is a 3x3 grid. Whoever reaches a straight line of consecutive 3 X's or O's wins. If there is no line with a straight X or O, then it is a tie. The game ends when a winner is announced or there are no available slots on the board.

Nouns: players, board (square, grid)
Verbs: place_square

Board (mark_square)
