# Example

                          # Expected output:
account.balance         # => 0
account.deposit(50)     # => $50 deposited. Total balance is $50.
account.balance         # => 50
p account.withdraw(80)    # => Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($50).
                          # Actual output: $80 withdrawn. Total balance is $50.
p account.balance         # => 50

=begin
This is because a setter method always returns the value of the passed-in argument, regardless
of what happens in the rest of the method and which line is the last evaluated line. In the 
`balance=` getter method defined on line 33, we intended to return a boolean but the getter
always return the value of the passed-in `new_balance` argument. As a result, when line 21 is
evaluated in the conditional, `success` always returns a truthy value.
