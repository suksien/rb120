=begin
On line 91, the `send` method is invoked on a `PostalService` object referenced by `johns...`. 
However, nether the class itself nor its `CommunicationsProviders` superclass provides the `send` 
method, causing Ruby to default to calling `Object#send`, resulting in a `NoMethodError` because
`Object#send` expects a method name as its first argument and we're passing in a string.

The `send` method can be found in the `Mailing` module, which can be mixed in to the class
to fix the issue. We should also change the method name to something different in order to not
override the `Object#send` method unintentionally.
=end

=begin
LS: due to `Object#send` method overriding in the `Mailing` module. 

The error message from invoking an undefined method is different than the output error message.
