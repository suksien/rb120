1. More natural (more closely approximates real world) code
2. Readable, easily maintanable
3. More modular and hence easily extendable
4. Highly flexible

LS:
- allows programmers to think more abstractly about their code
- objects represented by nouns so easier to conceptualize
- only expose functionality to the code that need it
- DRYer codes; easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication
- can build applications faster since can use pre-written code. 
- more easily managed
