1. Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.

21 is a card game between 2 players where each player takes turn drawing a card
from the deck until one player busts. The goal is to reach as closely as possible to 
21 without going over. In each round, the player can either hit (draw a card) or 
stay (not draw a card). 

Nouns: card, player, deck
Verb: draw, bust, reach, hit, stay

2. Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs into nouns and 
do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.

Deck: bust, reach
Player: draw, hit?, stay?, count card

class Deck
  def initialize
    @cards = {}
  end

end

class Card
  def initialize
    @value
  end
end

class Player
  def initialize
    @cards_at_hand = []
  end

  def draw
  end
  
  def hit?
  end
  
  def stay?
  end

  def count_cards
  end
end
